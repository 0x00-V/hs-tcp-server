# Haskell TCP Server

A simple HTTP server built with Haskell and Scotty. This project demonstrates basic web routing and response handling.


Build:
```bash
cabal build
cabal run
```

URL endpoints (localhost:3000/)
You can do localhost:3000/<Word> to view your word in the web page
This was my first project, and I followed:
https://hackage.haskell.org/package/scotty

I plan on doing some cool stuff with haskell. Keep an eye out on my profile!
